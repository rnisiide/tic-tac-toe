# Project Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was developed under The Odin Project - Full Stack JavaScript path.
It was a very interesting project, where the main goal was to create a tic-tac-toe game, but with a few pre requisites. Although initially it was very easy to set up the game, the logic and the parameters, adjusting the code to the requisites made it a tougher challenge. 
The main goal was  to have as little global code as possible, organizing the code inside factories and objects.
This resulted in a much more organized code, where my thought process for it had to take different solutions than what I previously had imagined.
